            <p>Students participate in this discussion-based forum to address specific issues adult learners 
            often face during the transitional first semester at Cal. Course discussions and assignments are 
            designed to coach students through the process of adjusting to academic life at Berkeley and all 
            the complexities it entails. Through this class, students expand strategies for managing the demanding 
            workload of this research university and build approaches for maximizing the opportunities available 
            throughout campus that directly shape the quality of the re-entry student experience. 
            This class affords the opportunity to network with other re-entry learners to build community and belonging. 
            Many re-entry students note that this course was foundational for their success at Cal.
